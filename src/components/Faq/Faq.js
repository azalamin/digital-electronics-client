                  afraid to learn from them either.

                <span>
                  Warehouse rates are determined by the warehouse footprint of
                  the product, how quickly the product will be moving in and out
                  of the warehouse as well as any specific handling and shipping
                  requirements that are required of an individual product. We
                  believe that there is no one price fits all when it comes to
                  warehousing products and we will structure our pricing to be
                  competitive and meet the needs of our customers.

                  We can store hazardous materials on a case by case basis
                  depending on the product. Please contact us about your hazmat

                <span className="px-4 py-2">
                  Transloading can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 5 hours
                  depending on how the product is received, and the services
                  that our customer is looking for. If the product arrives
                  palletized or in crates, then the process is usually very
                  quick, but if the product arrives loose and needs to be
                  individually unloaded, sorted and segregated and palletized
                  for shipment out, then it can often take hours.
